Computers can sometimes hang on checkin to the JSS for one reason or another. Often this is because of a policy or extension attribute that is having an issue. Annoyingly though, JAMF does not provide good enough logging to troubleshoot this process by default. jamfVerboseCheckins.sh will create a replacement LaunchDaemon for checkins that instead runs with the --verbose flag and outputs the log to /var/log/jamfv.log. jamfVerboseRecon is a script you should setup as a replacement recon policy for machines you wish to troubleshoot. Instead of choosing the normal update inventory option in the policy you run this script and set it to your preferred interval. This this additional logging finding issues with checkins should be much easier.

Note: in future versions I may add timeout options and log checking so that the checkins become self healing.
